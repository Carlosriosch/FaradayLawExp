# FaradayLawExp
 In this proyect we work with one solenoid and two resistences for experiment the Faraday's Law and refuse some "paradox". Is interesting becasue we shows that the f.e.m. is not localizaded, and is a clear experiment where the electric and magnetic fields are essencially the same. We use a lot of tools of differential calculus.
